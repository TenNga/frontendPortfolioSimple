                        What I am today is as a result of my technical skillset. Skills include; team-work, understanding of design patterns and problem-solving. Lessons learnt
                        so far - Respect comes of giving - The price of self discipline is too expensive that few can pay - Success comes from doing what you
                        love.

                            George is a resourceful and goal-driven web developer. His current focus is more on the frontend architecture of the web. He uses React as his main framework for developing component UIs and Redux for state management on web applications. He looks forward to learning Node.js for JavaScript runtime. Breaking complex problems using simpler lines of code is his ultimate goal in the field of tech.

                        <p>Its's about doing what I love and therefore, I write lines of code to enhance my problem-solving techiques and make the world a better place than I found it, both for the current and next generations. Nevertheless, gaming is my hobby and I love watching football with Manchester City being my boyhood club support.
